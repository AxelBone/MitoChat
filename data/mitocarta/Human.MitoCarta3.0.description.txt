Column_Name	Description
HumanGeneID	NCBI Entrez Gene ID for human ortholog of mouse gene (based on reciprocal BLASTP hit, expect<1e-3).  Note the last row includes an ENSEMBL identifier (ENSG00000230623) since Entrez does not include this gene yet.			
MouseOrthologGeneID	NCBI Entrez Gene ID for mouse gene			
Symbol	Official Entrez gene symbol from NCBI as of 08/31/2020			
Synonyms	NCBI Entrez gene synonyms (UniProt added at end) from NCBI as of 08/31/2020			
Description	NCBI Entrez gene description from NCBI as of 08/31/2020			
MitoCarta3_List	MitoCarta3.0, mito-interacting, otherwise 0.  Note mito-interacting is a tag indicating  genes not in MitoCarta3.0 and not residing within the double-membraned organelle, but with evidence of association with the mitochondrion or proteins embedded within the mitochondrial outer membrane (eg ER Mitochondial Associated Membranes, or cytosolic proteins binding to the signalling molecule MAVS), although this list is not exhaustive.			
MitoCarta3_Evidence	Type of experimental support			
MitoCarta3_SubMitoLocalization	Compartment within mitochondrion: matrix, MIM (mitochondrial inner membrane), IMS (intermembrane space), MOM (mitochondrial outer membrane), membrane, unknown.  Annotations are best guess based on literature, APEX experimental data to matrix, IMS, or MOM, presence of transmembrane helices (via TMHMM program).			
MitoCarta3_MitoPathways	List of manually curated biological pathways.			
TrainingDataset	For MitoCarta2.0: Tmito, Tnot_mito, or T_possible_mito (indicating evidence based on NCBI GO mitochondrial annotation or MitoP2 database, but not in Tmito); Deprecated indicates NCBI Entrez Gene was present in 2015 but deprecated by 2020;  NA indicates newly added to NCBI Entrez Gene, thus present in 2020 but not in 2015.			
MitoCarta2_score	NaÃ¯ve Bayes score (sum of log-likelihood ratios for each of 7 above features)			
MitoCarta2_FDR	Estimated corrected false discovery rate for all predictions >= given score			
MitoCarta2_List	1 if gene is on final MitoCarta2.0 list			
MitoCarta2_Evidence	Type of experimental support			
EnsemblGeneID	Ensembl Gene Identifier (based on Ensembl mapper)			
UniProt	UniProt Protein Identifier (based on UniProt mapper)			
ProteinLength	Length of longest RefSeq protein isoform			
TargetP_Score	TargetP confidence score (1-5, 1 is most confident) of mitochondrial targeting signal. Score 0 indicates no mitochondrial prediction			
MitoDomain_Score	MitoDomain indicates exclusively mito domain; SharedDomain indicates shared mito & non-mito domain; NonMitoDomain indicates exclusively non-mito domain; NA indicates unknown			
CoexpressionGnfN50_Score	N50 score for coexpression across mouse GNFv3 tissue atlas (N50 = number of 50 nearest neighbors that are in Tmito)			
PGC_Induction_Score	Foldchange in transcript induction following overexpression of PGC1a, known to induce mitochondrial biogenesis			
YeastMitoHomolog_Score	OrthologMitoHighConf (HomologMitoHighConf) if yeast ortholog (homolog) is annotated mitochondrial in SGD with high confidence; OrthologMitoLowConf (HomologMitoLowConf) if yeast ortholog (homolog) is annotated mitochondrial in SGD with low confidence (dual localized or only based on high throughput data), NoMitoHomolog indicates no yeast homolog or homolog is not annotated mitochondrial in SGD			
RickettsiaHomolog_Score	Ortholog if 1:1 ortholog between mouse and Rickettsia prowazekii; Homolog if homology between mouse and Rickettsia prowazekii, otherwise NoHomolog			
MSMS_Score	Category indicating MS/MS abundance (coverage) and enrichment in subtractive proteomics (either pure-enriched, crude-enriched, or ambiguous)			
mm10_Chromosome	Chromosome (mm10 assembly)			
mm10_Start	Start position (mm10)			
mm10_Stop	Stop position (mm10)			
MSMS_NUM_TISSUES	Number 0-14 tissues where gene products were found by MS/MS
